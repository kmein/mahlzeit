method:
  - Peel and roughly chop the onion in half, peel the garlic and chop the courgette up roughly. Throw it all in a food processor and blend to save time and energy chopping.
  - Heat up a large pan with some oil. Add in the vegetables and fry for a few minutes until softened.
  - Add in the chopped tomatoes, milk, water and puree and bring to a boil.
  - Pour in the pasta, and simmer until the pasta is cooked. Stir once or twice in between to make sure everything is mixed through as it cooks (donâ€™t over-stir though!)
  - When everything is cooked, season with salt and pepper, shake in a generous amount of nutritional yeast and stir everything once more.
