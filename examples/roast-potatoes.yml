ingredients:
  - ingredient: floury potatoes
    amount: 1500
    unit: g
  - ingredient: olive oil
    amount: 100
    unit: ml
  - ingredient: smoked paprika
    amount: 2
    unit: ts

method:
  - Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Add the potatoes to a pan of cold salted water, bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 mins until partly tender. Drain and steam dry for a few mins in a colander.
  - Return the potatoes to the saucepan, and add the oil, paprika and plenty of salt and pepper. Cover with a lid, then shake the pan around to roughen the edges of the potatoes and thoroughly coat them in the paprika and oil. Tip the potatoes into a large roasting tin, making sure they are evenly spaced apart. Scrape in all the fluffy potato mess â€“ these make the best crispy bits!
  - Roast the potatoes for 1 hr 15 mins, turning halfway, until extremely fluffy and crisp.
